Programs written by me:
         - examples.py
         - log_funcs.py

examples.py outputs 12 windows, 4 for each of the 3 examples. The console will 
show output pertaining to each example. The windows can be grouped easily
by the name of the window. Example run:

            python3 examples.py

log_funcs.py does not execute via a main call. It is a library that computes
LoG for the examples.py file.

Directories:
    images - This contains the input images.
    pspace - This contains outputs from the program. This should not be modified.
