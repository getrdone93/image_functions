Programs written by me:
         - examples.py
         - gui.py

examples.py runs the image examples and outputs six windows. The windows are paired together
by object. LoG is computed for three images under the images directory: field, flower, and tree. 
The console will show output that describes the good and bad qualities of the images. 
The example is simple to run:
   
           python3 examples.py

gui.py runs the GUI and allows the user to invoke the LoG function on the image. As noted in
the DISCUSSION file, the slider is not functional. After clicking the LoG button, the window
must be closed and the program restarted to see the changes. The GUI is simple to run:

           python3 gui.py

Directories:
    images - Input images used by gui.py and examples.py. This should not be modified.
